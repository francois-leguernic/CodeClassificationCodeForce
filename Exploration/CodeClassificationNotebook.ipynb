      "This is an interactive problem.Misha likes to play cooperative games with incomplete information. Today he suggested ten his friends to play a cooperative game \"Lake\".Misha has already come up with a field for the upcoming game. The field for this game is a directed graph consisting of two parts. The first part is a road along the coast of the lake which is a cycle of $$$c$$$ vertices. The second part is a path from home to the lake which is a chain of $$$t$$$ vertices, and there is an edge from the last vertex of this chain to the vertex of the road along the coast which has the most beautiful view of the lake, also known as the finish vertex. Misha decided to keep the field secret, so nobody knows neither $$$t$$$ nor $$$c$$$.  Note that each vertex of the field has exactly one outgoing edge and all the vertices except the home vertex and the finish vertex have exactly one ingoing edge. The home vertex has no incoming edges, the finish vertex has two incoming edges.At the beginning of the game pieces of all the ten players, indexed with consecutive integers from $$$0$$$ to $$$9$$$, are at the home vertex. After that on each turn some of the players can ask Misha to simultaneously move their pieces along the corresponding edges. Misha will not answer more than $$$q$$$ such queries. After each move Misha will tell players whose pieces are at the same vertices and whose pieces are at different vertices.The goal of the game is to move all the pieces to the finish vertex. Misha's friends have no idea how to win in such a game without knowledge of $$$c$$$, $$$t$$$ and $$$q$$$, but luckily they are your friends. Help them: coordinate their actions to win the game. Misha has drawn such a field that $$$1 \\le t, c$$$, $$$(t+c) \\leq 1000$$$ and $$$q = 3 \\cdot (t+c)$$$. \n",

      "You are a rebel leader and you are planning to start a revolution in your country. But the evil Government found out about your plans and set your punishment in the form of correctional labor.You must paint a fence which consists of $$$10^{100}$$$ planks in two colors in the following way (suppose planks are numbered from left to right from $$$0$$$):   if the index of the plank is divisible by $$$r$$$ (such planks have indices $$$0$$$, $$$r$$$, $$$2r$$$ and so on) then you must paint it red;  if the index of the plank is divisible by $$$b$$$ (such planks have indices $$$0$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$2b$$$ and so on) then you must paint it blue;  if the index is divisible both by $$$r$$$ and $$$b$$$ you can choose the color to paint the plank;  otherwise, you don't need to paint the plank at all (and it is forbidden to spent paint on it). Furthermore, the Government added one additional restriction to make your punishment worse. Let's list all painted planks of the fence in ascending order: if there are $$$k$$$ consecutive planks with the same color in this list, then the Government will state that you failed the labor and execute you immediately. If you don't paint the fence according to the four aforementioned conditions, you will also be executed.The question is: will you be able to accomplish the labor (the time is not important) or the execution is unavoidable and you need to escape at all costs. \n",

      "Levko loves permutations very much. A permutation of length n is a sequence of distinct positive integers, each is at most n.Let’s assume that value gcd(a, b) shows the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. Levko assumes that element pi of permutation p1, p2, ... , pn is good if gcd(i, pi) &gt; 1. Levko considers a permutation beautiful, if it has exactly k good elements. Unfortunately, he doesn’t know any beautiful permutation. Your task is to help him to find at least one of them. \n",

The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of $$$b_k$$$.For example, suppose we have the following matrix: $$$\\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 9 &amp; 7\\\\ 4 &amp; 144 &amp; 84 \\end{pmatrix}$$$ We construct the array $$$b$$$:  $$$b_1$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$, $$$9$$$, and $$$7$$$, that is $$$1$$$;  $$$b_2$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$4$$$, $$$144$$$, and $$$84$$$, that is $$$4$$$;  $$$b_3$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, that is $$$2$$$;  $$$b_4$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$9$$$ and $$$144$$$, that is $$$9$$$;  $$$b_5$$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$$7$$$ and $$$84$$$, that is $$$7$$$. So $$$b = [1, 4, 2, 9, 7]$$$. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to $$$9$$$.For a given $$$r$$$ and $$$c$$$, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer $$$0$$$.  \n",

It is aesthetically pleasing, and it has a number of remarkable properties. Help Rikhail to convince the scientific community in this!Let us remind you that a number is called prime if it is integer larger than one, and is not divisible by any positive integer other than itself and one.Rikhail calls a number a palindromic if it is integer, positive, and its decimal representation without leading zeros is a palindrome, i.e. reads the same from left to right and right to left.One problem with prime numbers is that there are too many of them. Let's introduce the following notation: π(n) — the number of primes no larger than n, rub(n) — the number of palindromic numbers no larger than n. Rikhail wants to prove that there are a lot more primes than palindromic ones.He asked you to solve the following problem: for a given value of the coefficient A find the maximum n, such that π(n) ≤ A·rub(n). \n",

Almost all cells of the field are white and only some of them are black. Currently Gerald is finishing a game of giant chess against his friend Pollard. Gerald has almost won, and the only thing he needs to win is to bring the pawn from the upper left corner of the board, where it is now standing, to the lower right corner. Gerald is so confident of victory that he became interested, in how many ways can he win?The pawn, which Gerald has got left can go in two ways: one cell down or one cell to the right. In addition, it can not go to the black cells, otherwise the Gerald still loses. There are no other pawns or pieces left on the field, so that, according to the rules of giant chess Gerald moves his pawn until the game is over, and Pollard is just watching this process. \n",

Whenever $$$l &gt; r$$$, they are swapped.After Vladik computes $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment $$$[l; r]$$$ of the initial array $$$a$$$ modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset.

Vladimir has just planted n bamboos in a row, each of which has height 0 meters right now, but they grow 1 meter each day.

Vladimir wants the total length of bamboo parts he will cut off to be no greater than k meters.What is the maximum value d he can choose so that he can achieve what he wants without cutting off more than k meters of bamboo? \n",

The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The $$$i$$$-th vertex also has an integer $$$k_i$$$ written on itself.A travel on this graph works as follows.   Gildong chooses a vertex to start from, and an integer to start with. Set the variable $$$c$$$ to this integer.  After arriving at the vertex $$$i$$$, or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex $$$i$$$, add $$$k_i$$$ to $$$c$$$.

For example, here is the graph for $$$D=12$$$:   Edge $$$(4,12)$$$ has weight $$$3$$$ because $$$12$$$ has divisors $$$[1,2,3,4,6,12]$$$ and $$$4$$$ has divisors $$$[1,2,4]$$$.

There is no edge between $$$12$$$ and $$$3$$$ because $$$\\frac{12}{3}=4$$$ is not a prime.Let the length of the path between some vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ in the graph be the total weight of edges on it.

      "Let's imagine: there is a chess piece billiard ball. Its movements resemble the ones of a bishop chess piece. The only difference is that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect from it and continue moving.More formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.  It is considered that one billiard ball a beats another billiard ball b if a can reach a point where b is located.You are suggested to find the maximal number of billiard balls, that pairwise do not beat each other and that can be positioned on a chessboard n × m in size. \n",

For example:  Permutation $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ will count, because the number of such $$$i$$$ that $$$p_i&lt;p_{i+1}$$$ equals $$$3$$$ ($$$i = 1$$$, $$$i = 2$$$, $$$i = 3$$$).

Sometimes it is used to denote a power ($$$a\\wedge b = a^b$$$) and sometimes it is used to denote the XOR operation ($$$a\\wedge b=a\\oplus b$$$). You have an ambiguous expression $$$E=A_1\\wedge A_2\\wedge A_3\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A_n$$$. You can replace each $$$\\wedge$$$ symbol with either a $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operation or a $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation to get an unambiguous expression $$$E'$$$.The value of this expression $$$E'$$$ is determined according to the following rules:   All $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operations are performed before any $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. In other words, the $$$\\texttt{Power}$$$ operation takes precedence over $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. For example, $$$4\\;\\texttt{XOR}\\;6\\;\\texttt{Power}\\;2=4\\oplus (6^2)=4\\oplus 36=32$$$.

The array $$$A$$$ is given by $$$A_i=2^{B_i}$$$ and the expression $$$E$$$ is given by $$$E=A_1\\wedge A_2\\wedge A_3\\wedge\\ldots\\wedge A_n$$$. You need to find the XOR of the values of all possible unambiguous expressions $$$E'$$$ which can be obtained from $$$E$$$ and has at least $$$k$$$ $$$\\wedge$$$ symbols used as $$$\\texttt{XOR}$$$ operation. Since the answer can be very large, you need to find it modulo $$$2^{2^{20}}$$$. Since this number can also be very large, you need to print its binary representation without leading zeroes. If the answer is equal to $$$0$$$, print $$$0$$$. \n",

For a single index (value $$$i$$$), this operation can be applied multiple times. If the operation is applied repeatedly to the same index, then the current value of $$$a_i$$$ is taken into account each time. For example, if $$$a_i=47$$$ then after the first operation we get $$$a_i=47+7=54$$$, and after the second operation we get $$$a_i=54+4=58$$$.Check if it is possible to make all array elements equal by applying multiple (possibly zero) operations.For example, you have an array $$$[6, 11]$$$.   Let's apply this operation to the first element of the array. Let's replace $$$a_1 = 6$$$ with $$$a_1 + (a_1 \\bmod 10) = 6 + (6 \\bmod 10) = 6 + 6 = 12$$$. We get the array $$$[12, 11]$$$.
